## My plan :D :

I am making a game where you have a map. You have to save the ocean and its ecosystem, as on the map you have some red dots that are the places with the trash and the problems. You have to survive 7 days to save the ocean from being totally poluted. In the battling with the trash it would be something like deltarune. The only problem is that I don't know how to organize the coding, (i am the only one coding it) as I have only 7 days to make it! I am using Next.js for the site + I will use JS for the game.
